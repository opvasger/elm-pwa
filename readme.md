# Elm PWA
A minimal PWA using Elm!

PWAs signify a bunch of features that are all enabled in this example:
1. Installable on desktop/homescreen.
2. Full offline-support.
3. Seamless upgrade when a new version is available.

Elm also brings a bunch of nice features to the table:
1. Extendable and maintainable codebase.
2. Very fast UI rendering.
3. Tiny compiler-output.

This PWA is based on the guidance from [the Google PWA site](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0).

It is built using [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) and [Elm-UI](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/).

This is just a dummy example that passes the audits in [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for PWAs.
